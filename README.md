### <b>3. Add Capabillity to openconnect_extension</b>

Repeat the step 1 for new target you created on previous step (openconnect_extension)

### <b>4. Add Pod dependency</b>

Open your Podfile , and add the following lines:

```
target 'openconnect_extension' do
  pod 'vpn_adapter_ios', :git => 'https://github.com/NavidShokoufeh/vpn_adapter_ios.git', :tag => '1.0.0'
end
```

And in your runner target do the same :

```
target 'Runner' do
pod 'vpn_adapter_ios', :git => 'https://github.com/NavidShokoufeh/vpn_adapter_ios.git', :tag => '1.0.0' <-- Add this line
  flutter_install_all_ios_pods File.dirname(File.realpath(__FILE__))
  target 'RunnerTests' do
    inherit! :search_paths
  end
end
```

### <b>5. Copy Paste</b>

Open openconnect_extension > PacketTunnelProvider.m and copy paste this script <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NavidShokoufeh/openconnect_flutter/refs/heads/main/example/ios/openconnect_extension/PacketTunnelProvider.m">PacketTunnelProvider.m</a>

## 6. Configure Build Settings and Deployment Targets

âœ… **This step is required to avoid build issues and ensure proper runtime behavior.**

---

### A. Set iOS Deployment Target to **15.0**

Set the deployment target to **15.0** for the following:

- **Runner Project**
- **Runner Target**
- **openconnect_extension Target**

You can configure this in Xcode by navigating to:

```
Build Settings > iOS Deployment Target
```

---

### B. Remove Unnecessary Linker Flags

- For the `**openconnect_extension**` target:
  - Go to `Build Settings > Other Linker Flags`
  - **Remove all linker flags**

- For the `**Runner**` target:
  - Go to `Build Settings > Other Linker Flags`
  - **Remove** the `-ObjC` flag

---

### C. Add Required Frameworks to `openconnect_extension`

In Xcode, go to:

```
openconnect_extension > Build Phases > Link Binary With Libraries
```

Click the `+` button and **add** the following:

- `libc++.tbd`
- `libresolv.tbd`



# Usage

## Setting up the VPN

To configure the VPN connection, use the setup method and pass an OpenconnectServer instance with the required configuration:

```dart
import 'package:openconnect_flutter/openconnect_flutter.dart';

final openconnectFlutterPlugin = OpenconnectFlutter();

final server = OpenconnectServer(
  host: 'vpn.example.com',
  port: 443,
  username: 'yourUsername',
  password: 'yourPassword',
  iosConfiguration: OpenconnectIOSConfiguration(
    enableCHAP: true,
    enablePAP: false,
    enableTLS: true,
    enableMSCHAP2: true,
  ),
);

bool setupSuccess = await openconnectFlutterPlugin.setup(server: server);
if (setupSuccess) {
  print('VPN setup successful!');
}
```

## Connecting to VPN

To connect to the VPN:
```dart
bool connectionSuccess = await openconnectFlutterPlugin.connect();
if (connectionSuccess) {
  print('Connected to VPN successfully!');
}
```

## Disconnecting from VPN

To disconnect from the VPN:
```dart
bool disconnectionSuccess = await openconnectFlutterPlugin.disconnect();
if (disconnectionSuccess) {
  print('Disconnected from VPN.');
}
```

## Checking Connection Status

To get the last known VPN connection status:
```dart
String status = await openconnectFlutterPlugin.lastStatus();
print('Last VPN status: $status');
```

# Limitations

- **Platform:** This plugin is only supported on iOS. Android support is not currently available.
- **Dependencies:** Ensure your iOS project is properly configured for VPN usage.
